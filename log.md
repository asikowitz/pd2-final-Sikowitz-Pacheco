06/02/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Learned more processing, dealt with processing problems on home computer<br>
06/03/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Made rudimentary processing code form moving a dot along a line (line.pde or Proc.java); Created log.md and updated README.md<br>
06/03/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Tried making adjustments to line running code <br>
06/03/14 : Kai Pacheco : Made a basic throwing objects with arrowhead pointers<br>
06/04/14 : Kai Pacheco : polished the arrow pointer<br>
06/04/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Remade line running code with classes (push screwed up) <br>
06/05/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Made player class, made player move and fall with acceleration, revamped the way the game interacts with keystrokes, prevented drawing walls on top of character, made walls disappear. <br>
06/05/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Created energy mechanic, made walls disappear, created jumping mechanic, allowed for multiple keys to be pressed down at the same time. <br>
06/05/14 : Kai Pacheco : Finished mechanics behind throwing items into the field with a pointer.<br>
06/06/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Studying Networking/Socket Programming<br>
06/07/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Testing basic socket programs (not pushed)<br>
06/08/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Testing networking implemented in game<br>
06/08/14 : Kai Pacheco : Made weapons more effeciently connected with each other<br>
06/08/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Created removal from wall arraylist and more mouse restrictions for drawing walls<br>
06/10/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Completely new implementation of networking (instead of both players having client and server, there is now one remote server and each player has a client)<br>
06/11/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Attempts to show walls from opposite players<br>
06/11/14 : Kai Pacheco : Added the drone and atomic bomb weapons<br>
06/12/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : More networking testing/research. Networking does not work over the internet (due to firewall/port forwarding issues?).
06/13/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Networking success at school--only between computers on the same system, however. Implemented sending information about the player location between computers.
06/14/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Merged files, creating weapon class files<br>
06/15/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Revamped merged files for more fluidity, specifically moving the "guide" methods to the main file and allowing for super() use in weapon constructions.<br>
06/15/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Many small fixes, such as cleaning up of useless code or making code more efficient or cleaning up graphics.<br>
06/15/14 : Kai Pacheco : Implemented Laser weapon and added homing missile <br>
06/16/14 : Kai Pacheco : Gave life to weapons and created weapon choice system <br>
06/16/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Created interaction between weapons and walls and players. Implemented display of weapons and explosions from opposite player (over network). Revamped detection of type of item from string to int. <br>
06/17/14 : Andrew Sikowitz : Cleaned up life and explosions of weapons. Created rough end of game.<br>
06/17/14 : Kai Pacheco : Added Player Power Ups <br>
Some logs are based on git commit history, because I (Andrew) forgot about this log...
